# SJF Scheduling
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

## Working
Asks the user to enter number of processes their names and burst time. If the process have different arrival timing then it will also asks for their arrival timing. After that it will calculate their waiting time and turn around time on the basis of arrival time and shortest burst time. On the basis of which it will calculate average waiting and turn around time.
